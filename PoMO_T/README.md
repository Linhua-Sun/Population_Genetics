# I set another python development environment. **bunnies**

The use PoMO is abit of different from usual way. We need to set up python 3.
The first is to use conda to install python 3.5 and several depentent libraries,such as numpy, scipy and pysam.
Installation of pysam is kind of trickly. You can refer to <https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam>.
After you can install all the software and their dependency, you should put libPoMo in your own pythonpath.

	**export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:/sdd1/users/linhua/Hang_He_Project/PopGen_Test_Project-2016-07-20/PoMO_T/PoMo/"**
